CsvKit
======

CsvKit is a parser for CSV data. It was created as a byproduct during the development of a parser for complex URL parameters. The focus was on speed and the safe handling of double-quoted strings, including the possibility of containing any characters (including other quotes). The implementation was based on a 2-pass tokenizer.
